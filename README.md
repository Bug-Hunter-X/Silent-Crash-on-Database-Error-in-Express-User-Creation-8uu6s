# Silent Crash on Database Error in Express User Creation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where database errors during user creation result in a silent crash, providing no useful information to the user.  The `bug.js` file contains the faulty code, while `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected implementation.

## Problem

The original code lacks proper error handling when interacting with the database.  If a database error occurs (e.g., a duplicate key violation, connection failure), the application crashes without sending a meaningful error message to the client.  This leaves the user unaware of the issue and hinders debugging.

## Solution

The solution implements comprehensive error handling by:

1. Validating user input before database interaction.
2. Catching database errors explicitly.
3. Sending informative error responses to the client, including appropriate HTTP status codes.
4. Logging errors for debugging purposes.

By following these best practices, the application becomes more robust and user-friendly.
